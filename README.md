# Data_Science_LIve_Exercises

Data Science exercises, in R script. 
Based on the tutorials proposed by **Data Science Live**, by Rob Campanell (org.).
All episodes avaliable from: [Data Science Live](http://datasciencelive.com/).

The general objective is to develop working skills with the R language and with IDE RStudio. 
This project has no commercial purpose.

Each file contains an answer to an episode. 
Details about the data sets, sources and resources used are available in each file.

I hope it can be useful to those who are learning R or to colleagues who are following the same practical exercises.
